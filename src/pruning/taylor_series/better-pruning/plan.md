Okay, using **Option C (More Granular Pruning)** makes the problem more interesting and potentially allows for finer-grained control and better trade-offs.

Here's how the approach adapts when you can apply *different degrees of pruning* to the sub-networks associated with each view, where the degree is inversely proportional to the view's importance, and a "pruning amount" acts as a global scaling factor for this:

**Conceptual Framework for Option C:**

1. **Normalized Inverse Importance:**

   * First, convert your `importance_values` into "prunability scores." A simple way is to take their inverse (add a small epsilon if importance can be zero) and then normalize them (e.g., to sum to 1, or to range between 0 and 1).
   * Let `prunability_score_j` be the score for view `j`. Higher `prunability_score_j` means view `j` is a better candidate for more aggressive pruning.
2. **Global Pruning Amount/Factor (`alpha`):**

   * This is the single "knob" you'll be tuning for each device. Let's call it `alpha`. `alpha` could range from 0 (no pruning) to 1 (maximum aggressive pruning based on prunability scores), or even higher if it makes sense in your pruning mechanism.
3. **Per-View Pruning Target Calculation:**

   * For each view `j`, the actual pruning target/aggressiveness applied to its sub-network would be a function of `alpha` and `prunability_score_j`.
   * Example: `target_pruning_for_view_j = alpha * prunability_score_j`.
   * This `target_pruning_for_view_j` then needs to be translated into actual pruning operations on the sub-network of view `j` (e.g., target sparsity percentage for filter pruning within that sub-network).

**Revised Algorithm for Each Device (using Option C):**

1. **Identify Device-Specific Constraints:**

   * `current_max_model_size = max_model_size_i`.
   * `common_min_accuracy = min_accuracy`.
2. **Pre-calculate Prunability Scores:**

   * From your `importance_values`, derive `prunability_score_j` for each view `j`.
3. **Iterative Search Over `alpha` (Global Pruning Amount):**

   * Initialize `best_model_for_this_device = null` and `best_model_score = -infinity`.
   * Define a range and step for `alpha` to explore (e.g., `alpha` from 0.0 to 1.0 in steps of 0.05 or 0.1). This creates your search space for `alpha`.
   * **Loop through different values of `alpha`:**
     a.  **Generate Pruned Model Candidate for current `alpha`:**
     *   Take your base MVCNN model.
     *   For *each* view `j`:
     *   Calculate `target_pruning_for_view_j = alpha * prunability_score_j`.
     *   Apply this `target_pruning_for_view_j` to the sub-network corresponding to view `j`. This is where your specific pruning mechanism comes in (e.g., if it's filter pruning, `target_pruning_for_view_j` might be the percentage of filters to remove in that sub-network).
     *   This results in a model where all view-specific sub-networks are potentially pruned, but to different degrees based on their importance and the global `alpha`.
     *   **Fine-tune** this comprehensively pruned model candidate.

     b.  **Evaluate the Candidate:**
     *   Measure `actual_accuracy`.
     *   Measure `actual_model_size`.

     c.  **Check Constraints:**
     *   Is `actual_accuracy >= common_min_accuracy`?
     *   Is `actual_model_size <= current_max_model_size`?

     d.  **If Constraints are Met:**
     *   This candidate (defined by `alpha`) is valid for the current device.
     *   Score the valid candidate (e.g., maximize accuracy, then minimize size, or use a combined score/reward function like `reward = your_reward_function(actual_accuracy, actual_model_size, common_min_accuracy, current_max_model_size)`).
     *   If the current candidate's score is better than `best_model_score`, update `best_model_for_this_device` and `best_model_score`.
4. **Store the Result for the Current Device:**

   * After iterating through all defined `alpha` values, `best_model_for_this_device` holds the optimal pruned model.
   * Add it to your list of 12 final models.

**Repeat for all 12 devices.**

**Refinements and Considerations for Option C:**

* **Mapping `target_pruning_for_view_j` to Actual Pruning:**
  * This is the most critical implementation detail. How does a numerical value like `0.3` (as `target_pruning_for_view_j`) translate into pruning filter N of layer M in view J's sub-network?
  * It could mean "prune 30% of the filters/channels in all prunable layers of view J's sub-network."
  * Or, it could be more nuanced, where the `prunability_score_j` itself is used to weight pruning *within* view J's sub-network if that sub-network itself has internal components whose importance can be estimated.
* **Granularity of `alpha`:** The step size for `alpha` determines the fineness of your search. Too small, and it's too slow. Too large, and you might miss optimal points.
* **Search Algorithm for `alpha`:**
  * Instead of a simple grid search over `alpha`, if evaluating each `alpha` (pruning + fine-tuning + evaluation) is very expensive, you could use more sophisticated 1D optimization techniques:
    * **Ternary Search / Golden Section Search:** If your reward function (as a function of `alpha`) is unimodal (has one peak).
    * **Bayesian Optimization (1D):** Can efficiently find the best `alpha` by building a probabilistic model of the reward function.
* **Calibration of Pruning Aggressiveness:**
  * The formula `alpha * prunability_score_j` is just one example. You might need to calibrate how `alpha` and `prunability_score_j` combine to control the actual pruning. For instance, if `prunability_score_j` is already normalized, `alpha` might directly represent the overall "percentage of maximum possible prunability" to apply.
  * You need to ensure that when `alpha` is at its max, the pruning is aggressive but not catastrophic, and when `alpha` is low, pruning is gentle.
* **Interaction between Pruning and Fine-tuning:** The amount of fine-tuning needed might vary with `alpha`. More aggressive pruning (higher `alpha`) might require more extensive fine-tuning.

**Your Reward Function's Role:**
Your function `reward = f(actual_accuracy, actual_model_size, min_accuracy_constraint, max_model_size_constraint)` becomes very central here for each device. The optimization process for `alpha` (for each device) will effectively be trying to find the `alpha` that:

1. Results in a model satisfying `min_accuracy_constraint` and `max_model_size_constraint`.
2. Among those, maximizes this `reward`.

This granular approach (Option C) offers a more powerful way to leverage view importances, potentially leading to models that are better optimized for each device's specific constraints because you're not just making binary decisions (prune view / don't prune view) but rather tuning the "volume" of pruning for each view's pathway.
